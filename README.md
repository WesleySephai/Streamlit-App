### BMI Calculator

Creating a BMI app calculator using streamlit library. It ask the user to enter the name, height and wight and it calculate the bmi.

### Digital Expense Tracker with Budget Insights 

I used Python (Flask framework), HTML/CSS for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the backend. The goal was to track personal spending, enforce budgets, and provide automated alerts. Flask allowed me to keep the application lightweight and flexible. PostgreSQL was ideal for storing structured user transaction data, while Streamlit provided a clean interface for real-time data entry.
